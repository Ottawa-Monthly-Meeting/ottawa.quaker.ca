The Meeting house will be open for in-person Meeting for Worship from Sunday, Jan 29th, 2023 until further notice.

As an experiment, in-person Meeting for Worship will be held without remote technology on the third Sunday of February and March (Feb 19, and Mar 19).  Meeting for Worship will also be held on Zoom, but will not be connected to the Meeting House.

We have begun holding Blended Meeting for Worship beginning at 10:30 am on Sundays, but are taking several steps to safeguard our community.  Please [read this article for details](https://ottawa-monthly-meeting.github.io/ottawa.quaker.ca/archive/ottawa.quaker.ca/newsletter/create-article-60.html). **For online attendance Please contact the Clerk for the Zoom Link.**   

**Our Sunday Schedule:**  Meeting for Worship and First-day (Sunday) School - 10:30 a.m. every Sunday. (If you arrive late you will be asked to wait until 10:45 to enter:  it is less disruptive to have all the late-comers enter together.) Potluck after Meeting for Worship most first Sundays of the month. Meeting for Business after Meeting for Worship most second Sundays of the month.
